Frozen Bubble v1.8
==================

An OUYA port of the Frozen Bubble game.  Developed with Android Developer 
Tools v21.0.1-543035, and ODK v0.0.5.

The code is based on the Java version of Frozen Bubble created by Glenn
Sanson.  The original Frozen Bubble was created by Guillaume Cottenceau
(programming), Alexis Younes and Amaury Amblard-Ladurantie (artwork) and
Matthias Le Bidan (soundtrack).

Note:  as currently configured, the external library paths expect the ODK
to be installed in "/opt/OUYA-SDK" on a Linux (or possibly Mac OS X) 
build machine.  If one chooses to build using Android tools on a Windows
machine, or to install the ODK in a different location, will need to 
properly include OUYA support libraries, per the ODK docs.

The Android port, just like the original Frozen Bubble, is covered by
GNU GPL v2.
